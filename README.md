This repository is an official Pytorch implementation of "Ske2Grid: Skeleton-to-Grid Representation Learning for Action Recognition",
dubbed Ske2Grid. The paper is accepted to ICML 2023.

Ske2Grid, a progressive representation learning framework conditioned on transforming human skeleton graph into an up-sampled grid representation, which is dedicated to skeleton-based human action recognition, showing leading performance on six mainstream benchmarks.
