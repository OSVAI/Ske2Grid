This repository is an official Pytorch implementation of ["Ske2Grid: Skeleton-to-Grid Representation Learning for Action Recognition"](https://openreview.net/pdf/a0ef5a344fff97a1caaa9861ced153d1113cb84d.pdf),
dubbed Ske2Grid. The paper is accepted to ICML 2023.

## Overview

Ske2Grid, a progressive representation learning framework conditioned on transforming human skeleton graph into an up-sampled grid representation, which is dedicated to skeleton-based human action recognition, showing leading performance on six mainstream benchmarks.

Comparison of convolution operations in GCNs and in our Ske2Grid. In Ske2Grid, we construct a regular grid patch for skeleton representation via up-sampling transform (UPT) and graph-node index transform (GIT). Convolution operation upon this grid patch convolves every grid cell using a shared regular kernel. It operates on a set of grid cells within a squared sub-patch which may be filled by a set of nodes distributed remotely on the graph, achieving a learnable receptive ﬁeld on the skeleton for action feature modeling. In the figure, the up-sampled skeleton graph is visualized assuming the locations of the original graph nodes being unchanged for a better illustration.

(a) The overall framework of Ske2Grid: the input skeleton graph with $N$ joints is converted to a grid patch of size $H\times W$ using a pair of up-sampling transform (UPT) and graph-node index transform (GIT), which is then fed into the Ske2Grid convolution network for action recognition. (b) Ske2Grid with progressive learning strategy (PLS): the input skeleton is converted to a larger grid patch ($H'>H, W'>W$) using two-stage UPT plus GIT pairs. The well-trained Ske2Grid convolution network for the ﬁrst-stage grid patch as in (a) is re-used to initialize the network for the second-stage grid patch as in (b), and the ﬁrst-stage UPT plus GIT pair is ﬁxed during training. PLS is used in a cascaded way to boost the performance of our Ske2Grid convolution network with increasing grid patch size.
